<h1>About me!</h1>
<p>I currently am going to school at Corner Canyon High School. My favorite subject is math and science. I am currently 15 years old and getting older. I love to go mountain bike, ski, and hang out with friends when I'm free. I am very hard working and will not stop until I get the job done!</p>
